## Intro

OCSwap is a multi-chain transaction aggregator that streamlines token distribution and collection across major blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Base L2. The platform aims to reduce the overhead of signing multiple transactions by providing a user-friendly interface and an underlying smart contract framework that automates bulk transfers and collections in a single transaction signing flow.

## Most asked questions:

If you are trying to use the application, you will need to use your own custom RPC, which you can get for free from [https://www.helius.dev/](https://www.helius.dev/) when you sign up (we are soon going to let everyone use a public key to make it easier to do transactions and disperses)

Once you get your RPC key, paste it in the settings area&#x20;
